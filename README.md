# Chris-Text-Adventure
This is my text adventure for the final project:
I plan on making a text adventure that will take place in a newly discovered ancient temple. I have changed some things about the game itself, I do want it to be more combat related now. Th story is that you want to explore the temple but realize there is a great evil there. The goal is to fight your way out.

There will be plenty of randomization within the game in order for it to work. I want to have all the enemies to be random as well as the loot you get from defeating them. The loot will be more of a trophy system, luck will also play into how much treasure you get.  I also plan on using randomization when it comes to the players stats, I want it to be like you need to get lucky when it comes to combat.

When it comes to the story the player will choose different paths that will change what happened, There will be surprises if you make the wrong choices. This will require many If statements.

My goal is to make a text adventure game that has choices and wont be completely the same each time.

Stretch goals: make weapons that drop have random stats and be able to equip better weapons

Super stretch goals: Achievement system that tells you what achievements you got during game
