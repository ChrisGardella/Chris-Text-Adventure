# Chris-Text-Adventure

The way this game works is there will be a series of events where the player can choose what to do from two options.
Depending on what the players choose it will change the story. The way I made this game work was using the Random module.
I imported random, which is already included with python in order to choose what type of character the player is, what enemy
would spawn as well as the damage amount when fighting.

In order for this game to work properly I hve been using Python version 3.7, if it is an earlier version the inputs will not work and the program will not run.
